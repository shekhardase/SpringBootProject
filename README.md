## Project Description

This Spring Boot project implements a simple RESTful API for managing journal entries. It integrates with MongoDB for data storage using Spring Data MongoDB. The project follows a standard MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture:

- **Controller**: Defines REST endpoints for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on journal entries.
- **Service**: Contains business logic, though not explicitly used in this project.
- **Repository**: Interacts with the MongoDB database for data access and manipulation.
- **Entity**: Represents the structure of a journal entry.

The project provides endpoints to:

- Retrieve all journal entries
- Create a new journal entry
- Retrieve a journal entry by ID
- Delete a journal entry by ID
- Update a journal entry by ID

It's a simple yet functional application that demonstrates how to build a RESTful API with Spring Boot and MongoDB integration.
